				  <h3>Reading</h3>
			  <p>I love reading high fantasy series! I used to be the biggest bookworm as a kid, but I lost interest until January of this year. I try to read whenever I have time, like on the train or late at night. Some of my latest top reads have been The Poppy Wars, Throne of Glass, and Mistborn. I love reading physical books, but I don't want to buy them just for one read, so I sometimes I spend the day reading in the big Barnes and Nobles in Union Square. </p>

				  <h3>Concerts</h3>
			  <p>I love listening to music! If you know me, you will always catch me wearing my beats and listening to my really long Spotify playlist. I have a bunch of different genres in my playlist like indie rock, pop, edm, and more. 3 weeks ago, I went to the Arctic Monkey's concert in Forrest Hills, Queens wih one of my best friends. It was so much fun and we both thought that it was an amazing experience. To the left, you can see a clip from the concert!</p>

				  <h3>Baking</h3>
			  <p>Althought I don't bake much, I always bake a cake for my parent's and brother's birthday. I would love to learn more about baking and cooking because I find it really fun and relaxing. The picture on the left is of the lemon cake I made for my brother's birthday</p>

					<h3>Sports</h3>
			  <p>I love working out at the gym and I usually go around 5 times a week right after school or in th emiddle of the day during the weekends. Sometimes I go with my friends, but I usually work out by myself. It's so rewarding and I always feel so happy right after lifting a bunch of heavy weights. I'm also on the girl's wrestling team at tech. It requires a lot of work and commmitment, but I really like it and I think that its 100% worth it! On the left you can see a picture of me wrestling (i'm in the blue getting a takedown on the other girl)</p>
