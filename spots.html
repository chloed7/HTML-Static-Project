				  <h3>Anita Le Mamma del Gelato</h3>
			  <p>This is my favorite frozen dessert spot in nyc! I've taken all my friends and family there and they all LOVED it. Their prices for the amount of gelato you get is so good, their flavors are really delicious, and they add new ones frequently. To top it off, there are unlimited free samples! There and two locations in the city, one in flatiron and on near central park, but I always go to the one in flatiron. My favorite order is Caramel Cheesecake Cookies with White Chocolate Pretzel and Strawberry Mascarpone in a cone.</p>

				  <h3>Brooklyn Bridge</h3>
			  <p>I love walking across the brooklyn bridge with my friends in the evening. The views of the city, especially when the sun sets, are gorgeous. Even if there are a lot of people, I always end up having such a good time with my best friends. This picture is from one of the times I was hanging out with my friend in the city and then we spontaneously decided to walk across the bridge. </p>

					<h3>Barnes and Nobles</h3>
			  <p>As I have previously mentioned, I love getting a iced coffee, and spending a few hours just reading in barnes and nobles. The one in union square is the biggest barnes and nobles to exist and it has such a good selection of books. It's also in a good area so there's a lot of places to go eat afterwards. Anita's is super close and I like getting a bagel from Tompkins Square bagels. </p>

					<h3>Boardwalk in Coney Island</h3>
			  <p>I really like walking on the boardwalk, but it was made so poorly that it's so easy to fall every few minutes. There are wooden boards sticking out in every direction and the section of the boardwalk that they recently renovated has already been destroyed. It would be really nice if it would finally be properly fixed so that it would be nicer to walk and bike there. </p>
